README for Falcon Flight Hours Tracker
--------------------------------------

I'll put some real README material up once I have some real functionality in
this thing.  Until then, here's the bare bones for anyone who cares enough to
try to get it working on their machine:

Requires:

- Python (http://python.org/download/)
- wxPython (http://wxpython.org/download.php#stable)

My test setup:

- Windows 7 and Ubuntu Oneiric
- Python 2.7, wxPython 2.8.11 (64-bit)

So if your computer looks like that, there's something seriously wrong if it
doesn't work for you.  I haven't done the necessary setup for easy deployment,
though, so it could be a pain to get working correctly, especially if you're
on Windows and you've never run a Python program from source before.

Download, extract somewhere, and run::

  (On Windows)
  > C:\Python27\python main.pyw
  (On Linux)
  > python main.pyw

Disclaimers 'n' Stuff
---------------------

This program is for convenience only and is not a substitute for careful
attention; government-, company-, and union-endorsed software; or other
official means of verifying compliance with regulations.  It is the pilot's
responsibility to ensure that he/she is in accordance with all applicable
regulations and safety procedures when operating an aircraft.  I make no
guarantees of accuracy or completeness of the output of this program.

(In short: this is a silly hobby project.  There will be bugs in it.  Don't
make people's lives depend on its correctness.)
